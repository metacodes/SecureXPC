/// Sends sequential responses to an ``XPCClient`` for a specific route.
///
/// Instances of this class are provided to handlers registered with an ``XPCServer`` for routes with sequential reply types:
/// - Async without a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-6sxby``
/// - Async with a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-7ngxn``
/// - Synchronous without a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-7r1hv``
/// - Synchronous with a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-qcox``
///
/// It is valid to use an instance of this class outside of the closure it was provided to. Responses will be sent so long as the client remains connected.
///
/// Any errors generated while using this provider will be passed to the ``XPCServer``'s error handler.
///
/// Once a sequence has been either explicitly finished or finishes because of an encoding error, any subsequent operations will not be sent and
/// ``XPCError/sequenceFinished`` will be passed to the error handler. If a sequence was not already finished, it will be finished upon deinitialization of this
/// provider instance.
///
/// While provider instances are thread-safe, attempting concurrent responses is likely to lead to inconsistent ordering on the client side. If exact ordering is
/// necessary, it is recommended that callers synchronize access to a provider instance.
///
/// ## Topics
/// ### Responding
/// - ``respond(withResult:)``
/// - ``success(value:)``
/// ### Finishing
/// - ``finished()``
/// - ``failure(error:)``
/// - ``isFinished``
